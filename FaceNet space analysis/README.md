All of code required for reproducing the analyses I have demonstrated is in the 'masks vs embeddings comparison_GPIBDS' notebook.

Face embeddings can be created using the code in the 'makeEmbeddings_FaceNet' folder; the only change required is a path to the folder containing the images.

GPIBD patients' face embeddings are precomputed and are contained in the 'gpibdfaceEmbeddingsDict' dictionary, loaded in the analysis notebook mentioned above.
