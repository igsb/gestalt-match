# FaceNet embeddings calculation

The getEmbeddings notebook demonstrates how the input images from a given path were preprocessed and the 128-embeddings created and
afterwards saved as a pickled Python dictionary object.
A pre-trained model version 20170512-110547 was used.

The face detection code comes from the authors of MTCNN: https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment
The code for loading up the model comes from: https://github.com/arunmandal53/facematch
